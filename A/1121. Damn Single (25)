"Damn Single (单身狗)" is the Chinese nickname for someone who is being single. You are supposed to find those who are alone in a big party, so they can be taken care of.
Input Specification: 
Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (<=50000), the total number of couples. Then N lines of the couples follow, each gives a couple of ID's which are 5-digit numbers (i.e. from 00000 to 99999). After the list of couples, there is a positive integer M (<=10000) followed by M ID's of the party guests. The numbers are separated by spaces. It is guaranteed that nobody is having bigamous marriage (重婚) or dangling with more than one companion.
Output Specification: 
First print in a line the total number of lonely guests. Then in the next line, print their ID's in increasing order. The numbers must be separated by exactly 1 space, and there must be no extra space at the end of the line. 
Sample Input:
3
11111 22222
33333 44444
55555 66666
7
55555 44444 10000 88888 22222 11111 23333
Sample Output:
5
10000 23333 44444 55555 88888
