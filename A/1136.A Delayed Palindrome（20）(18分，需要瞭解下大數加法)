1136 A Delayed Palindrome（20 分）
Consider a positive integer N written in standard notation with k+1 digits a
​i
​​ as a
​k
​​⋯a
​1
​​a
​0
​​ with 0≤a
​i
​​<10 for all i and a
​k
​​>0. Then N is palindromic if and only if a
​i
​​=a
​k−i
​​ for all i. Zero is written 0 and is also palindromic by definition.
Non-palindromic numbers can be paired with palindromic ones via a series of operations. First, the non-palindromic number is reversed and the result is added to the original number. If the result is not a palindromic number, this is repeated until it gives a palindromic number. Such number is called a delayed palindrome. (Quoted from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindromic_number )
Given any positive integer, you are supposed to find its paired palindromic number.
Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case which gives a positive integer no more than 1000 digits.
Output Specification:
For each test case, print line by line the process of finding the palindromic number. The format of each line is the following:
A + B = C
where A is the original number, B is the reversed A, and C is their sum. A starts being the input number, and this process ends until C becomes a palindromic number -- in this case we print in the last line C is a palindromic number.; or if a palindromic number cannot be found in 10 iterations, print Not found in 10 iterations. instead.
Sample Input 1:
97152
Sample Output 1:
97152 + 25179 = 122331
122331 + 133221 = 255552
255552 is a palindromic number.
Sample Input 2:
196
Sample Output 2:
196 + 691 = 887
887 + 788 = 1675
1675 + 5761 = 7436
7436 + 6347 = 13783
13783 + 38731 = 52514
52514 + 41525 = 94039
94039 + 93049 = 187088
187088 + 880781 = 1067869
1067869 + 9687601 = 10755470
10755470 + 07455701 = 18211171
Not found in 10 iterations.
