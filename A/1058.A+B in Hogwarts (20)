1058 A+B in Hogwarts (20)（20 分）
If you are a fan of Harry Potter, you would know the world of magic has its own currency system -- as Hagrid explained it to Harry, "Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it's easy enough." Your job is to write a program to compute A+B where A and B are given in the standard form of "Galleon.Sickle.Knut" (Galleon is an integer in [0, 10^7^], Sickle is an integer in [0, 17), and Knut is an integer in [0, 29)).
Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case which occupies a line with A and B in the standard form, separated by one space.
Output Specification:
For each test case you should output the sum of A and B in one line, with the same format as the input.
Sample Input:
3.2.1 10.16.27
Sample Output:
14.1.28

		c[1]%=17;
	}
	printf("%d.%d.%d",c[0],c[1],c[2]);
	return 0;
